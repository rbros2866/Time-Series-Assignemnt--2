    "**Visual Inspection:** Visualizing the data using plots such as line plots, histograms, or seasonal subseries plots can provide initial insights into the presence of seasonal patterns. Patterns that repeat at regular intervals over time are indicative of time-dependent seasonal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seasonal Decomposition:** Decomposing the time series into its constituent components—trend, seasonality, and residual—using methods like additive or multiplicative decomposition can help isolate the seasonal component. Once separated, the seasonal patterns can be examined more closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Autocorrelation Function (ACF):** Plotting the autocorrelation function can reveal the presence of periodic correlations at specific lags, indicating seasonal patterns. Peaks at lag intervals corresponding to the seasonal frequency suggest the presence of time-dependent seasonal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF):** Analyzing the partial autocorrelation function can help identify the lag orders of autoregressive terms in the data. Significant spikes at seasonal lags indicate the presence of seasonality.\n",

    "**Moving Averages:** Applying moving average techniques, such as centered moving averages or exponentially weighted moving averages, can help smooth the data and highlight underlying seasonal patterns.\n",
